## masonite-organisations

**This is a Work In Progress** package.

This is going to be a way to easily add organisations management with user roles and invitations for your Masonite projects.
It might be inspired from `django-organisations`.

## Setting up

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

Then install from the requirements file

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install Masonite and a few development related packages like pytest.

Finally you can run the tests and start building your application.

```
$ python -m pytest
```

## Use it
